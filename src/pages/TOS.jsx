              <li>
                Pixelite Digital offers clients domain names in certain packages. It should be understood that, until payment is fully received from the client to the provider (Pixelite Digital),
                the provider will be the owner of the domain name.

            Social Media Optimisation (SEO)
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pixelite Digital have zero control over the ranking alogrithms of search engines. Algorithms used by search engines are constantly changing, 
                and the content and/or sites allowed one day, could change another. It is as the discretion of a search engine if they exclude/limit your site, completely 
                out of Pixelite Digital's control.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pixelite Digital is unable to guarantee top placements for competitive keywords and phrases. Search engines are competitive, and SEO efforts don't always guarantee the top places. We
                do not guarantee Number One, or top 10 positions for any keyword, phrase or search term.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clients should understand that ranking new websites can take time, and that search engines naturally take a while to index and register newer sites. Instant results won't be seen, and should not be 
                seen as form of under performance. Old, established websites will naturally adapt to SEO at a faster pace due to already being indexed, and having a foundation to be built on.

                may be charged, at the discretion of the provider, at an extra cost. The client will be made aware of this at the time.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the final logo design is approved, the logo design will be sent to you as digital files. It is the responsibility of the client to provide
                an appropriate destination for these files to be sent to.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is the responsibility of the client to provide the provider with any necessary information to be present on the graphical design. The ommitance of information could be included
                as a revision/set of alterations, at the complete discretion of the provider.
